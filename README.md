# Automatic-generation-of-comments-on-Twitter-based-on-news
Bachelor's degree final project

This project aims to create a bot that is able to comment news on Twitter using machine learning techniques. You can download the nmt bot that posts on twitter here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5sbzqwiihf9gknl/nmt-chatbot.tar.gz?dl=0 

To use it just execute the inference.py on the nmt folder.

In the python transforming data folder, there are the files to transform normal datasets into training data for the nmt bot.

For further information read the final document.pdf.
